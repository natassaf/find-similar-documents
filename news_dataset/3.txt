Russian troops are intensifying their attacks on the key eastern town of Avdiivka, a senior Ukraine officer said on Thursday, while the country’s general staff reported its military repelled many Russian assaults in widely separated sectors of the front.

Oleksandr Borodin, press officer for Ukraine’s third separate assault brigade, said Russian forces were launching major infantry attacks, while trying to keep equipment intact.


Borodin told the news outlet Espreso TV there were no dramatic statistics for destroying enemy equipment "because they use it much less, mainly from a distance.

"But their movements are quite dense now. It is not just infantry advancing but also parallel work of artillery, drones, aviation, the same air bombing and more."

Russian forces, he told Espreso, were unable to replenish supplies quickly and Ukrainian defensive positions were solid.

Elsewhere, Ukrainian special forces have damaged multiple Russian landing ships docked in northwestern Crimea following an overnight operation, footage has purported to show.

The GUR said in a post on X this morning: “As a result of a night operation on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, small landing ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation were damaged by soldiers.”
