On 7 October 2023, an armed conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip[o] after the latter launched a multi-pronged invasion of southern Israel. After clearing Hamas militants, the Israeli military retaliated by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gazan targets, and followed up with a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza. More than 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, and more than 10,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children,[39][40] have been killed in the fighting.[41] The current hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[42]

In the morning of 7 October, militants in Gaza launched a barrage of rockets against Israeli cities and kibbutzim while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier. Over 1,000 Israeli mostly civilians were killed and over 200 civilians and Israeli soldiers were captured.[43] Hamas said its attack was in response to the blockade on Gaza, continued settlements, Israeli settler violence, and restrictions on movement between Israel and Gaza.[44][45][46][47]

Israel's declaration of a state of war the following day marked the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War; its lengthy aerial bombardment of Gaza dropped 6,000 bombs in the first six days of the conflict.[48] The airstrikes were coordinated with a total blockade of the Gaza strip in addition to cutting off water, fuel, food and electricity.[49][50] Israel urged 1.1 million Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, while Hamas called on residents to stay in their homes;[51][52][53] on 27 October, Israel launched a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip which remains ongoing.

Widespread civilians deaths have led to both Israel and Hamas being accused of war crimes.[54][52] The United Nations reported that around 1.5 million Palestinians, over 70% of Gaza's population,[37] as well as over 200,000 Israelis have been internally displaced.[55] There are acute shortages of drinking water, food and fuel in Gaza.[56] The Gazan health system is failing; nearly half of all hospitals are out of service due to shortages of fuel and power, and medical surgeries like C-sections and amputations are being performed without anesthetic due to shortages of medical supplies.[57]

The war has led to intense global protests that have focused on a variety of issues including demands for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and opposition to the actions of both Israel and Hamas. Anti-Israeli protests in particular have been described as the largest since those against the Iraq War.[58] The United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire;[59] a week later, a less binding resolution passed overwhelmingly in the United Nations General Assembly.[60]
